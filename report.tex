\section{Implementation of thread-safe \textit{getenv()}}
This version of implementation includes a mutex lock, called env_mutex.
It used a pthread key to save the result of the environment variable.
when a shared variable \textit{envbuf} NULL, it will traverse the environ to get the environment variable and save it to \textit{envbuf}, also unlock the mutex.
After saving the result, the key \textit{envbuf} will not be NULL and return the result.
